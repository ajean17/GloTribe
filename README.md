# GloTribe - Undergraduate Research Project
built with Laravel MVC Framework

GloTribe is a social media platform for independant artists.  As people become more accessible to one another, relationships grow weaker and less meaningful.  As a result, reliable relationships are becoming fragile associations.  In the world of art, it can be especially difficult to manifest grand ideas that require collaboration when networks are small or feeble.

GloTribe features an Event and Review system.  Users can create postings for Events that others can request to be a part of.  This allows artists to come together for the sake of collaboration and artisitic innovation.  The review system keeps track of user experiences with each event to provide a sense of what it may be like to work with others and incentive to work with a certain degree of professionalism.
